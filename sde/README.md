Steps to get it working:
pip install -r requirements.txt
activate the environment
python app.py 

Machine Learning concepts used :
- SURF Feature Detector
- Multi-layer Perceptron classifier
- Supervised Learning

Social media app developed using :
- Flask
- Peewee ORM 
- Sqlite database for simplicity


Since it is developed as a part of a hackathon (1 day event), technically a lot can be improved.
